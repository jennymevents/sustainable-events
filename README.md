# Sustainable Events & Experiences

Events, whether they are virtual or in-person, have a significant footprint on the environment. They are vital for organizations, customers, industries, and communities to network, make announcements, offer educational opportunities, increase sales and account support, and provide opportunities for connection.   

To comply with and support sustainable and zero-waste commitments, intentional practices must be implemented to events and community-driven experiences. Sustainability must be fully integrated into the strategy, planning, programming, logistics, operations, and execution. Additionally, diversity, equity, inclusivity, and environmental justice must be prioritized by generating significant impact through awareness, community-driven initiatives, and commitments.
  
## Usage

Utilize this repository to reference the [Sustainable Events & Experiences Playbook](./playbook.md) to learn best practices. A [Code of Conduct](./sustainable-event-code-of-conduct.md) is included, since a Code of Conduct should be published for any in-person or virtual experience, no matter the audience or subject matter.

## Why

Experiences, events, and productions have a significant impact on the environment and the communities living in it. Here you will find the resources to support planning, communicating, and executing sustainable practices for anything from large conferences, tradeshows, productions, and virtual experiences.

## What's Included

* [playbook.md](./playbook.md)
  * As the organizers and contributors of the technology industryâ€™s most impactful events and community experiences, we need to take a collaborative approach to address the shift to more virtual and online experiences due to COVID-19. Utilize the playbook to review the different types of digital experiences, key digital event elements, virtual event standards and requirements, and additional resources and best practices. 
* [sustainable-event-code-of-conduct.md](./sustainable-event-code-of-conduct.md)
  * A Code of Conduct specifies a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and cultures can communicate effectively, productively, and respectfully. This is imperative at both in-person and virtual events. The Code of Conduct included within this repository can be used for online experiences to both protect and inform the audience of the standards of behavior the organizers require to participate.
* [inclusive-planning-process.md](./inclusive-planning-process.md)
  * Hosting an inclusive event requires inclusivity intentionally woven throughout the entire event process, especially from the beginning. Utilize this guide to ensure you have a diverse planning committee, inviting diverse speakers and participants, and constantly finding ways to evolve and improve.

  * Leverage the playbook example to start creating an event specific playbook applicable to the audience, demographic, topic area, and scope. Download the file and then manipulate it based on the event's needs and goals.

  * Use the playbook checklist to integrate sustainability and inclusion from start to finish within the planning process. Download the file and then manipulate it based on the event's needs and goals. Different scores can be allocated when specific initiatives or checklist items are completed to determine how your event measures in achieving environmental and equitable goals.
